    "## Welcome to the First Python Project! \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a simple and interactive game using Python, incorporating fundamental programming concepts and Python basics. This project aims to reinforce your understanding of core Python principles while fostering creativity through game development. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Game options:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guess the Number:\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it.\n",
    "Provide hints like \"too high\" or \"too low\" after each guess.\n",
    "Include a limited number of attempts and a score system based on accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hangman:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a word bank and randomly select a word for the player to guess.\n",
    "Display the current state of the word with blanks for unrevealed letters.\n",
    "Allow a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tic-Tac-Toe:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.\n",
    "Ensure proper input validation and display the game board after each move.\n",
    "Declare the winner or a draw when the game concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Snake Game:\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a classic Snake game using the console.\n",
    "Control the snake with arrow keys, and let it grow longer with each food item.\n",
    "Implement collision detection and keep track of the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note: you can explore implementiong any other game of your choice.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two types of requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements:\n",
    "Technical Requirements are designed to guide you on your project. These will help point you in the right direction as well as show you what we will be looking for when reviewing your project. These requirements will be focused towards the specific coding aspects you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "Functional Requirements are designed to provoke thought throughout your project. These will be based in theory rather than code. These requirements will assist in shaping your output of each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make sure to read all of the instructions at least twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border:2px solid\">\n",
    "<h1 style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 3em;\">Project Requirements</h1>\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-top:1px dashed\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use functions to modularize your code and promote code readability.\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling for user inputs to avoid crashes.\n",
    "- Ensure the game provides clear instructions and feedback to the player.\n",
    "- Add comments to explain complex sections of your code.\n",
    "- Create a README file that includes instructions on how to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Optional:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter.\n",
    "- Add sound effects or background music to enhance the gaming experience.\n",
    "- Create additional levels or features to make the game more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will require an assortment of counter variables that will have to be set on a global scale (they exist outside of all functions). It will also be required to use at least two function that you write. I would recommend you create the barebones of the game, then pretty it up. Do not worry about making incredibly detailed print statements and formatting until you finish the base game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide pseudocode and/or flowchart\n",
    "- Write at least Two function\n",
    "- Check the user input for any types of non-numeric answers or those that are not expected by the program (when applicable)\n",
    "- Use several global counters to keep track of user's statistics\n",
    "- Incorporate a Graphic User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "- Code must have comment's explaining what you did following coding style standars and documentaton best practices\n",

    "# Rock Paper Scissors Game Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import libraries\n",
    "- Import `random` library for the computer choices in the game\n",
    "- Import `tkinter` library for GUI purposes (Graphic User Interface)\n",
    "- Import `messagebox` from `tkinter` to display result message after game finishes\n",
    "- Import `Python Image Language` for `Image` and `ImageTk` that handles images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the game logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Class\n",
    "-The `Game` class encapsulates the logic of the Rock Paper Scissors game. \n",
    "-It provides methods for getting the computer's choice, getting the user's choice, determining the winner, and playing the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `get_computer_choice()`\n",
    "- **Static Method**: This method is marked with `@staticmethod` because it doesn't rely on any instance-specific data. \n",
    "- It simply returns a random choice of \"Rock\", \"Paper\", or \"Scissors\" for the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `get_user_choice()`\n",
    "- **Static Method**: Similar to `get_computer_choice()`, this method is marked with `@staticmethod` because it doesn't require any instance-specific data.\n",
    "- It prompts the user for input and returns their choice after validating it against the list of valid choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `get_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`\n",
    "- **Static Method**: Again, marked with `@staticmethod` because it operates on the input choices without needing access to instance-specific data.\n",
    "- It compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `play()`\n",
    "- **Class Method**: This method is marked with `@classmethod` because it operates on the class itself rather than an instance of the class. \n",
    "- It simulates playing the game, alternating between getting the user's choice and generating the computer's choice until one side wins three rounds or five rounds have been played.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the game GUI \n",
    "\n",
    "### `play_game()`\n",
    "- This function creates and runs the Tkinter GUI for the Rock Paper Scissors game\n",
    "- Uses the image library to import a background onto the game\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `play_round()`\n",
    "- Nested function to handle the gameplay when a button is clicked\n",
    "- Also updates the game's statistics and results display\n",
    "- If either the user or computer wins three rounds, display a message box indicating the game's result and reset the game\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `reset_game()`\n",
    "- Reset game statistics and clear labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialise variables for tracking game statistics\n",
    "- `computer_choice_label`: Label to display the computer's choice.\n",
    "- `rounds_played_label`: Label to display the current round number.\n",
    "- `result_label`: Label to display the result of each round.\n",
    "- `score_label`: Label to display the current score of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create buttons \n",
    "- Create buttons for the game choices (\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\") using a loop and place them on the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create labels\n",
    "- Create labels to display computer choice, round number, result, and score, and place them on the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start Tkinter\n",
    "- Start the game using `play_game()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each button representing a game choice (\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\") has a command attached to it, which calls the `play_round` function with the corresponding choice.\n",
    "- Inside `play_round`, the computer's choice is determined using the `get_computer_choice` method from the `Game` class, and the winner is determined using the `get_winner` method.\n",
    "- Game statistics such as the number of rounds played, user wins, and computer wins are updated accordingly.\n",
    "- If either player wins three rounds, a message box is displayed indicating the game's result, and the game is reset.\n"
